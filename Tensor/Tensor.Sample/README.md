# Example project for F# Tensor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeepMLNet/Tensor.Sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeepMLNet/Tensor.Sample)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wrun3ku66kl09ki6?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/surban/tensor-sample)

This is an example project that demonstrates the capabilities of the [F# tensor library](http://www.deepml.net/Tensor).

## System requirements

* Linux, MacOS or Microsoft Windows (64-bit)
* [Microsoft .NET Core 2.0 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/)
* For GPU acceleration (optional): [nVidia CUDA GPU with recent driver](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

## Running

Clone this repository and execute `dotnet run`.

If you encounter problems, check the [troubleshooting guide](http://www.deepml.net/Tensor/articles/Troubleshooting.html).

## Documentation

This example does not show all features of the library.
Visit the [Tensor at a glance](http://www.deepml.net/Tensor/articles/Tensor.html) page to get an overview of what the library can do.
