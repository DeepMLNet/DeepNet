- next steps?

- rename SymTensor -> Tensor.Expr? => DONE
- implement loging => Done
- write first tests?
	- find old test project

- it would make sense to write basic tests
  i.e. create expression
  derive expression
  access channels of expression
  try slicing
  - no real basic tests exist yet, so we should write them

- Interpolator should probably be moved to tensor


- check if anything useful is left in UExpr
- implement direct eval, i.e. formal host eval


- how to handle variables from now on?
- problem is that variables have been simple expressions before
- but this makes referencing them a bit problematic
- so make variables a separte thing that must be created and converted to an expression?
- other problem was that two variables with same name but different shapes were treated as different variables
