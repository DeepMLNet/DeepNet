- it would make sense to write basic tests
  i.e. create expression
  derive expression
  access channels of expression
  try slicing
  - no real basic tests exist yet, so we should write them

- Interpolator should probably be moved to tensor


- check if anything useful is left in UExpr
- implement direct eval, i.e. formal host eval
