- How to handle SymTensorCuda?

- should contain no cuda invocation code anymore
- but how to handle element expressions?
- they still need to generate kernels
- perhaps split off to completely seperate project


1. Merge SymTensorCuda and SymTensor
2. Think about ElemExpr code
3. Remove direct CUDA calls from SymTensor
4. Make backend work for both host and Cuda (what about Streams?)
