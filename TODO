- Problem:
	- now that we have two argument types (single-channel expression and multi-channel expression)
	  and two expression types, iterating over the tree is complicated
	- how to solve this?
	- Provide a union view, where each argument is exposed as single-channel or multi-channel.
	- Change argument to be a union themselves, either consisting of case a) single-channel expression or
	                                                                 case b) multi-channel expression + channel
