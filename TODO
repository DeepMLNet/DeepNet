- How to handle SymTensorCuda?

- should contain no cuda invocation code anymore
- but how to handle element expressions?
- they still need to generate kernels
- perhaps split off to completely seperate project


1. Merge SymTensorCuda and SymTensor
2. Think about ElemExpr code
3. Remove direct CUDA calls from SymTensor
4. Make backend work for both host and Cuda (what about Streams?)


- no modifications required in SymShape.fs
- no modifications required in SymSizeEnv.fs
- no modifications required in Vars.fs
- no modifications required in ElemExpr.fs
- ElemExprHostEval should be renamed into ElemExprInterpreter to indicate that its purpose
  is interpreting ElemExprs => Done
- Interpolator.fs can stay as-is for now
- no modifications required in Expr.fs


 - What can be used as a TensorDevice?
