TODO:
	- get training of line following neural network to work
	- for that we need:
		1. find out how it was done in Python
		2. check if necessary tools are available
		3. convert or load numpy files
		4. build model
		5. train it
		6. compare training performance
		7. optimize as needed


Need to make one big array for dataset.
Write DataSet class.



have lots of .npz files:
	- can read numpy files
	- write function that reads them and creates a dataset array
	- generic dataset class?
