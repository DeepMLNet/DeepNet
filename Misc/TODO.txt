TODO:
	- get training of line following neural network to work
	- for that we need:
		1. find out how it was done in Python
		2. check if necessary tools are available
		3. convert or load numpy files
		4. build model
		5. train it
		6. compare training performance
		7. optimize as needed


have lots of .npz files:
	- need to read and convert to HDF5
	- also need to think about how to layout dataset, i.e. training testing
	- generic dataset class?
