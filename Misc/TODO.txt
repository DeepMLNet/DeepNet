- what is necessary to make CUDA copy kernel work?
  1. Tensor structure in F#
    - structure has dynamic size
	- to make kernel invocation efficient we should build it
	- DONE.

  2. Generating wrapper code with extern "C"
    - how to best implement type-safe wrappers?
	- DONE.

  3. nvrtc invocation
	- DONE.

  4. module loading
    - DONE.

  5. kernel invocation
