This directory contains prebuilt Intel MKL libraries for Deep.Net.

Intel MKL can be obtained from
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/free-mkl
and the binaries are redistributable according to
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/which-intel-math-kernel-library-intel-mkl-libraries-are-redistributables

Only the functions listed in funcs.txt are included in the library.
After changing the list run build.cmd (Windows) and build.sh (Linux) to rebuild the binaries.
You need an Intel MKL installation for that.
