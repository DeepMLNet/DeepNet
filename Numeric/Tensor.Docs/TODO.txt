TODO:

- TOC linking
- fix broken links

- move host only functions to HostTensor


- How to design the move?
- the static functions are easy, but what about the member functions?
- it is not possible to do it as an extension because that would apply to all tensors
- so the API become necesarily inconsistent
- Yes, but this is probably not that bad...
- let us first move the frontend and then see what to do about the backend stuff
